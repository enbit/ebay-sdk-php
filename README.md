# EBAY-SDK-PHP

This project is a copy from [fshch/ebay-sdk-php](https://github.com/fshch/ebay-sdk-php) which build on [davidtsadler/ebay-sdk-php](https://github.com/davidtsadler/ebay-sdk-php). 

Because the original project is dead,so I create this new project.This project is not compatible with original project.

Original Readme file is renamed to README_origin.md
fshch Readme file is renamed to README_fshch.md

## What is different with the original project

   we will see
   
## Requirements   
   - PHP 7.2 or greater with the following extensions:
      - cURL
      - libxml 
   - 64 bit version of PHP recommended as there are some [issues when using the SDK with 32 bit](http://devbay.net/sdk/guides/getting-started/requirements.html#using-the-sdk-with-32-bit-systems).
   - SSL enabled on the cURL extension so that https requests can be made.
## Installation
The SDK can be installed with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).   
 1.

     ```
     composer require enbit/ebay-sdk-php
     ```

## Others
Please read the README_origin.md and README_fshch.md files.
